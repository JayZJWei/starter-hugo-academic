I am an MS student at Case Western Reserve University. I am interested in pursuing a career in medicine and planning to do clinical research in the future, including research on obesity, diabetes, and mental health disorders. Due to my master's program, I am currently interested in analyzing large health care databases to promote better health care policy changes.
